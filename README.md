# BiomedBench
## General Information
BiomedBench is an open-source benchmark suite of TinyML biomedical applications targeting low-power wearbles [1].

This repository contains a set of biomedical applications designed to run in low-power wearable platforms for patient monitoring.

All applications are coded in C/C++. For each application, we include a Desktop version and the ported versions to different commercial platforms. 

## Applications
- ### Heartbeat Classifier (HeartBeatClass)
    The HeartBeatClass [2] detects abnormal beating patterns in real time for common heart diseases using the ECG signal. For further details check [1].
- ### Seizure Detector SVM (SeizureDetSVM)
    The SeizureDetSVM [3] works on ECG input and recognizes real-time epileptic episodes. For further details check [1].
- ### Seizure Detector CNN (SeizureDetCNN)
    The SeizureDetCNN [4] is based on EEG data and detects real-time epileptic seizure episodes. For further details check [1].
- ### Cognitive Workload Monitor (CognWorkMon)
    The CognWorkMon [5] is designed for real-time monitoring of the cognitive workload state of a subject and is based on EEG input. For further details check [1].
- ### Gesture Classifier (GestureClass)
    The GestureClass [6] aims to classify hand gestures by inspecting signals captured by sEMG of the forearm. For further details check [1].
- ### Cough Detector (CoughDet)
    The CoughDet [7] is a novel application using non-invasive chest-worn biosensors to count the number of cough episodes people experience per day, thus providing a quantifiable means of evaluating the efficacy of chronic cough treatment. For further details check [1].
- ### Emotion Classifier (EmotionClass)
    The EmotionClass [8] classifies patients’ fear status to prevent gender-based violence based on three physiological signals: Galvanic skin response (GSR), PPG, and skin temperature (ST). For further details check [1].
- ### Biological backpropagation-free (BioBPfree)
    BioBPfree [9] is the only benchmark that performs on-device training. For further details check [1].
